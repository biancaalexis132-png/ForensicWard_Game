# AI handoff

This is where one agent tells the next exactly what it did and where to resume. Rules for writing and reading it are in `AGENTS.md` §7. Newest entry first; never edit or delete an older entry, add a correction in a new one.

A file cannot contain the SHA of the commit that adds it. So each entry records the **latest verified commit** it describes (the last commit whose contents and tests the entry vouches for). The commit that adds the entry sits on top of it; find it with `git ls-remote origin <branch>`. If the branch tip has more than that one doc commit on top of the recorded SHA, someone pushed after the entry was written: read `git log <recorded-sha>..origin/<branch>` before you trust it.

## Active workstreams

One row per branch that someone is working on. Claim the folders or files you will edit, so two agents never change the same file in parallel without a plan. Remove your row when the branch merges or is abandoned.

| Workstream | Branch | Agent / session | Latest verified commit | Claimed files | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sprint 1 foundation | `claude/sprint-01-foundation` (PR #1) | Claude | `f626aad7be1c9a443762a5b2cd3591601c1b14bc` | Whole branch; waits on integration plan | Awaiting owner review and merge |
| Audio production | `claude/audio-production` | Claude (separate session) | none pushed yet | `audio/**`, `tools/audio/**`, `systems/audio/**`, `scenes/audio/**`, `tests/audio/**`, `docs/AUDIO*.md` | Active, not on GitHub yet |
| Environment art | `claude/environment-production` | Claude (separate session) | none pushed yet | Blender sources, exported `.glb`, environment scenes (paths to be recorded by that session at its first push) | Active, not on GitHub yet |
| Handoff system | `claude/ai-handoff-system` | Claude | `8e64eafb7ef7e8a68153852f97807eaee576dae4` (base) | `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md` | Draft PR |

Unclaimed high-conflict files that need an agreed plan before editing: `project.godot`, `autoload/EventBus.gd`, `scenes/main/Main.*`, `tests/qa/run.py`, `.github/workflows/*`, `README.md`.

## Entry template

Copy this block to the top of the log and fill every field. Write "none" rather than leaving a field out.

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC · <agent> · <workstream>

- **Branch:** `<branch>` (based on `<base branch>` at `<short sha>`)
- **Latest verified commit:** `<full 40-character sha>` "<subject line>"
- **Confirmed on GitHub:** `git ls-remote origin <branch>` printed `<sha>` at <time>
- **Pull request:** #<n> (draft / ready / merged) or none
- **State:** finished / unfinished but coherent / WIP that does not import (say which file)

**Accomplished**
- <what now works, with file paths>

**Files modified**
- `<path>`: <one line on the change>

**Unfinished**
- `<path>` `<function or node>`: <what it does now, what it still has to do>

**Known errors**
- <exact error text, file:line, how to reproduce> or none

**Tests** (on `<sha>`)
- `<exact command>`: <pass/fail counts, or "not run" and why>
- CI: <link to the run, or "not observed">

**Dependencies not available to remote agents**
- <model weights, local paths, GPU-only tools, Mac-only checks, secrets> or none

### 2026-10-17 15:40 UTC · Claude Code · Handoff system

- **Branch:** `claude/ai-handoff-system` (based on `main` at `8e64eaf`)
- **Latest verified commit:** `8e64eafb7ef7e8a68153852f97807eaee576dae4` "Merge pull request #3 from biancaalexis132-png/claude/quirky-ptolemy-6j16b7". This branch adds one documentation commit on top.
- **Confirmed on GitHub:** `git ls-remote origin` at 15:20 UTC showed `main` at `8e64eaf`, `claude/sprint-01-foundation` at `f626aad`, `codex/sprint-01-tests` at `d1d7479`, `claude/quirky-ptolemy-6j16b7` at `c58efc9`. `claude/audio-production` and `claude/environment-production` did not exist yet.
- **Pull request:** draft PR from `claude/ai-handoff-system` to `main`
- **State:** finished; documentation only, no game code changed

**Accomplished**
- Added the shared rules file, the Claude pointer, the status board and this handoff log.

**Files modified**
- `AGENTS.md`: new. Shared rules for Claude and Codex: read order, Godot 4.7 conventions, branch policy, test commands, asset standards, clinical governance, handoff protocol.
- `CLAUDE.md`: new. Points Claude Code to `AGENTS.md`; adds only Claude-specific notes.
- `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`: new. Every branch and system with status and evidence, blockers, PR #1 integration risks.
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`: new. This file.

**Unfinished**
- none

**Known errors**
- none in this change. Separately, PR #1 conflicts with `main` (`project.godot`, `autoload/EventBus.gd`); see `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` → Integration risks.

**Tests**
- On `main` at `8e64eaf`: `python3 tests/qa/run.py --godot Godot_v4.7-stable_linux.x86_64` (4.7.stable.official.5b4e0cb0f, SHA-512 verified) passed: both JSON checks OK, TestPharmacology 0 failures, QA 16 passed / 0 failed / 2 skipped, TestAudio 92 passed, Ch1 sequence done, boot OK.
- On `claude/sprint-01-foundation` at `f626aad`: `godot --headless --path . res://scripts/tests/TestRunner.tscn` gave 43 passed, 0 failed, exit 0.
- CI: run 39043906579 on `main` at `8e64eaf` succeeded. This PR adds only Markdown; its CI run should be checked on the PR.

**Dependencies not available to remote agents**
- none for this change. For other workstreams: Kokoro model files in `tools/audio/models/` (ignored, download per `tools/audio/requirements.txt` and the audio session's notes); ACE-Step and Stable Audio need the owner's Mac; Mac rendering and input checks need the owner.

**Next steps**
1. Owner reviews and merges this PR so `AGENTS.md` is on `main` and every new branch inherits it.
2. Audio and environment sessions: at your first push, replace your row's "none pushed yet" with the full SHA, list your claimed paths, and add a log entry using the template.
3. Owner decides the PR #1 integration plan in `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`. Then one agent runs it on `claude/integrate-sprint-01` from `main`, and records it here.
4. After PR #1 lands, move `docs/clinical_review_log.md` and `docs/design/` references in `AGENTS.md` from "on the foundation branch" to plain paths.

**Notes for the other agent**
- No `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` existed on any branch before this; established decisions were taken from `README.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/SPRINT_01.md`, `docs/design/*`, `docs/clinical_review_log.md` and `staging/README.md`, which are unchanged.
- The owner merges to `main`. Do not merge, push to `main` or enable auto-merge.
